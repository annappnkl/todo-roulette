\f1  Task Roulette App \'96 Overview & MVP Plan\
This document outlines the vision, positioning, target audience, and MVP plan for a unique task management app designed for students, freelancers, and remote workers. Unlike traditional to-do lists, this app uses a gamified, adaptive approach to planning tasks, balancing productivity with personal goals and self-care.\

\f0 \uc0\u55357 \u56524 
\f1  Positioning: The Flexible Study & Task Planner for Students\
Most productivity tools are built for corporate professionals, but students, freelancers, and remote workers don\'92t work like that. This app is designed to respect the flexible and ever-changing schedules of students while ensuring they stay on track.\

\f0 \uc0\u55356 \u57263 
\f1  Who is it for?\

\f0 \uc0\u9989

\f0 \uc0\u55357 \u56481 
\f1  Why is it different?\

\f0 \uc0\u55357 \u56960 
\f1  Unlike traditional to-do apps, this tool adapts to real life:\
- 
\f0 \uc0\u55356 \u57266 
\f1  **Shuffles tasks** \'96 No more decision fatigue; fun and work tasks are mixed dynamically.\
- 
\f0 \uc0\u9203

\f0 \uc0\u55357 \u56518 
\f1  **Adapts to real schedules** \'96 Syncs with classes, meetings, and real-life constraints.\

\f0 \uc0\u55357 \u56613 
\f1  Key Features & Benefits\

\f0 \uc0\u9989 
\f1  **Gamified Task Selection (Task Roulette)** \'96 A fun way to keep productivity high by randomizing tasks intelligently, ensuring a mix of study, work, and self-care.\

\f0 \uc0\u9989 
\f1  **Flexible Task Splitting** \'96 Long tasks (e.g., 'Study for 2 hours') are automatically broken into smaller, manageable chunks, preventing burnout and improving focus.\

\f0 \uc0\u9989 
\f1  **Personal Goals & Self-Care Scheduling** \'96 Users can schedule personal growth activities like reading, cooking, or watching a video, making it easier to stick to personal development plans. The gamification aspect ensures that these activities are part of the day rather than feeling like procrastination.\

\f0 \uc0\u9989 
\f1  **Real-Time Adaptive Planning** \'96 Instead of forcing users into a rigid schedule, the app adjusts the remaining work time dynamically based on actual progress, reducing stress and improving flexibility.\

\f0 \uc0\u9989 
\f1  **Balanced Work & Fun Ratio** \'96 Users can set an ideal ratio (e.g., 80% work, 20% fun) so the app ensures that work doesn\'92t become overwhelming while still keeping productivity high.\
Users get a small section of \'84Anytime\'93 tasks, that should be done throughout the week or month. These tasks serve as a surprise factor, so your whole day isn\'92t totally planned and just shuffled.\

\f0 \uc0\u9989 
\f1  **Follow-Up Task System** \'96 If a new task emerges while working (e.g., needing to send an email after receiving a document), the app allows follow-up tasks to be scheduled effortlessly.\

\f0 \uc0\u9989 
\f1  **Calendar Integration for Realistic Planning** \'96 Meetings, classes, and other calendar events are imported, and their time is subtracted from the total work goal to prevent overloading the schedule. Users can assign these calendar events to task groups for better tracking.\
